# sia-upsurging


This is a python implementation of the UPstream SURface Gradient cappING (UPSURGING) scheme which inhibits mass conservation violation (negative ice thicknesses) in shallow ice approximation ice flow models based on finite differences. The key assets of this method are its simple implementation and low computational cost. For more details see Appendix C of the dissertation of Michael Andreas Imhof, "Combined climate-ice flow modelling of the Alpine Ice Field during the Last Glacial Maximum", 2021, ETH Zurich, dissertation no. 27416, DOI:???
