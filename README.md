# sia-upsurging


This is a pyhon implementation of the UPstream SURface Gradient cappING (UPSURGING) scheme which inhibits mass conservation violation (negative ice thicknesses) in shallow ice approximation ice flow models based on finite differences. The key assets of this method are its simple implementation and low computational cost.
